# User Experience

## User Personas

### Primary: Property Manager
- Needs to provide a professional application process
- Requires comprehensive tenant information
- Values efficiency and standardization

### Secondary: Prospective Tenant
- Needs clear instructions and guidance
- Values ease of use and accessibility
- Requires confidence in data security

## Key User Flows
1. Form Access and Initial Load
   - User arrives at the application page
   - System loads saved progress (if any)
   - User begins or continues application

2. Form Completion
   - User progresses through form sections
   - System validates input in real-time
   - Progress is auto-saved

3. Form Submission
   - User reviews completed application
   - System generates PDF
   - User prints or saves application

## UI/UX Considerations
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Clear section navigation
- Progress indicators
- Accessible form controls
- Error prevention and recovery
- Consistent styling and branding

# Technical Architecture
